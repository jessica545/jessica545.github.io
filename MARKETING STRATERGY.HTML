<h1>MARKETING STRATERGY</h1>

   <p>IKEA is known for having it’s own marketing tactic called “the IKEA effect,” this tactic was creating to allow consumers to feel as if their “part of the process.” The incentive that the customer has to assemble the furniture item they’ve purchased physiologically has made them feel like “co-creators,” Studies performed by Harvard’s school of Business showed that people take more value in products that require time and effort to use. As a result, customers are able to justify paying 63% more for furniture if it requires time and energy to assemble after purchasing. For IKEA, they took this statistic and decided to profit from it by implementing it into their practices. 
</p>
<p>Distinctive branding, much like other companies, IKEA has a very distinct branding and logo. Made up of the enlarged bold letters coloured bright sunshine yellow on an entirely blue building, their branding stands out and it is noticed heavily upon customer traffic. Subconsciously, potential customers see the bold logo and become inclined to stop solely based on the first impression of the logo. 
</p>
<p>Catalog marketing, IKEA has a large presence in holiday catalogs and magazines, they set up scenes with elaborate furniture pieces and decor that are staged with the interest of family homes in mind. Captivating consumers with ideas of how easy yet creative decorating their homes could be, they promote customers to buy the full sets and all the decor shown as thats what the consumer wishes their home to be decorating like.
