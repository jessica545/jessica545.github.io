<h1>ECONOMIC ASSESMENT</h1>

<div class="main">
    <h2>Demand, Supply, Economy</h2>
    <h4>Demand</h4>
<div class="d">
    <p>One major important aspect of Ikeas demand is the competitive low prices . These low prices are the result of Ikeas well-tuned business model (Rosenfeld, 2022). For example, factors such as how much Ikea produces of one product in bulk affects the price that consumers pay for the product (Rosenfeld, 2022). To keep this low, Ikea produces its product in bulk and buys the materials for production in bulk, thus cutting costs within the first steps of production (Rosenfeld, 2022). Furthermore, something as simple as Ikeas packaging helps cut costs as the flat packaging that products ship in allows for money to be saved in shipping and warehouse storage costs (Rosenfeld, 2022). This packaging also correlates with the environmental policies discussed below.
</p>
    <p>One key feature of Ikea that helps drive its demand is its policies that incorporate a more circular economic approach as well as basic environmental practices such as minimal amounts of extra space in packages and recycled particle board in their products (Magyar, 2022). Another such policy is its recycling and refurbishment of old furniture products from Ikea, for example Ikea offers a program where they will buy back old products and sell them to new consumers at a discounted rate (Our circular agenda – ikea global). This environmentally friendly business practice caters to consumers looking to make smarter choices regarding the environment while still keeping prices low.</p>

    <h4>Supply</h4>
<div class="d">
    <p>Ikea's supply is driven by multiple different factors, the most notable and evident being new Technologies that can manufacture and process products more efficiently as well as human resources available for the transport and manufacturing of products.
</p>
<p>A recent example of new technologies being implemented would be in Ikea’s components facilities. Previously inventory was managed via workers using forklifts, this method limited productivity (Mecalux). Ikea saw this and implemented technologies that managed inventory using an automated storage and retrieval system(Mecalux). This system helps increase productivity of the businesses’ supply operations by working 24/7 and limiting the possible errors that could occur. The new system is just one of the multiple ways Ikea implements new technologies to keep up with demand.
</p>
<p>Ikea's supply is also greatly influenced by problems that arise with sourcing from suppliers on the global market (Ringstrom, 2021). Epidemics, tariffs, and other such limiting factors can cause a multitude of supply chain issues. One such example is that of what happened during the Covid-19 epidemic. During this time suppliers in China had issues transporting product through ports which resulted in Ikea running into supply chain issues that had to be resolved by finding alternative transport methods (Ringstrom, 2021).
</p>
</div>
    <h4>Type of Economy</h4>
<div class="d">
    <p>Ikea operates in a multitude of economies around the world with its primary economies being all of North America, most of Europe, and locations in China (Wikipedia, 2024). Although Ikea operates in a variety of locations around the world through the use of franchising (Wikipedia, 2024), their headquarters are currently located in the Netherlands which is defined as a highly regulated mixed economy (Britannica). One possible reason for Ikeas headquarters being in the Netherlands is that through the use of a company like INGKA Holdings, and their association with a Dutch non-profit, Ikea can pay less taxes (McComb, 2017). For this reason last year Ikea avoided paying up to 33 times less in taxes than other competitors which resulted in improved profits (McComb, 2017).
